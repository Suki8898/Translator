[Screen Translator](https://github.com/OneMoreGres/ScreenTranslator) + AI ðŸ¤–

Now, I have no idea if some of those fancy paid APIs actually workâ€”because, well, Iâ€™m too broke to afford them. But hey, Gemini, Groq, Github is free and OpenRouter has a few free models too, so why not give it a shot?
As for my coding skills... let's just say my code might look like a dumpster fire. But who cares? As long as it runs, it works!
Iâ€™d be incredibly grateful for any support during tough times. If youâ€™d like to help, you can treat me to a meal [here âœ¿](https://paypal.me/suki8898)
Thank you so much!

Copy the necessary files into the Translators folder, add your API key, and modify the remaining code to fit your needs

Note: Every time you edit the file (âœ… gemini_api.js), you need to uncheck it (â¬œ gemini_api.js) > click Apply, then check it again (âœ… gemini_api.js) > click OK.
Or simply restart Screen Translator!
